# The Tank Game

The Tank Game is a simple game that comes from the same series as Tetris,
played on the same device.
The user plays a tank,
which has to shoot other enemy tanks while avoiding their projectiles.
The goal is simply to have the highest score without gzeztting killed.

The Tank Game itself is already coded in Java (**TODO : add link**),
but as we want to apply methods to solve / optimize the plays,
Python was more suitable for us so we re-implemented the game (which was not the difficult bit).

## Content of the project

The project is far from being done at this stage.

The game exists, and that's it.
We need to implement all kinds of methods, RL and Monte Carlo Search,
to experiment with them on this particular game.

This is an academic project.
Nothing really relevant except the Python "implementation" of the game,
that is not playable for now. (and will only be if I have some extra time where I'm REALLY bored)
